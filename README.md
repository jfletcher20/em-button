Repository for the development of electromagnetic button technology.

The arduino code allows the device to work completely independently of desktop software.

The desktop software made in Unity is there to demonstrate how to use the API and take advantage of the two-way communication with the device, to create API requests to copy and paste into your own projects or to change the settings on the device and callibrate it.

This was my bacchelor's degree thesis.
